				</p>
				<p>
					TBD - We are still looking at different options for hotel blocks in the Estes Park area.
				</p>
				<h3>Transportation</h3>
				<p>
					Renting a car is the easiest way to get up to Estes Park.
					Our venue recommends this option. They also noted that AWD isn't a requirement.
					The road up there isn't too crazy but it will be winter so keep that in mind.
					We will try to connect guests beforehand who are attending to try to facilitate carpooling where possible.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you don't feel comfortable driving in the winter there is also the <a href="https://www.estesparkshuttle.com/" target="_blank">Estes Park Shuttle</a> which leaves from the Denver Airport.
				</p>
				<h3>Things To Do</h3>
				<p>
					Rocky Mountain National Park - Steps from our venue RMNP is beautiful in the winter. Great for hiking, snowshoeing, sledding, backcountry skiing or a senic drive.
				</p>
				<p>
					Downtown Estes Park - Lots of shops and resturants to check out.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dorsey Pond - A great place to go ice skating.
